I created this application as part of my learning process to better understand and practically apply modern technologies in web development. The application is built on Next.js with a backend that leverages various AWS services. The goal of this project is to create a functional platform capable of processing data, offering filtering options, and allowing the addition of new data, while also demonstrating integration with multiple cloud services to ensure stability and efficiency.

Although the application is not overly complex in its architecture, it allows for the use of various technologies, such as Tailwind for styling, Redux Toolkit for state management, and AWS for hosting and managing databases.
